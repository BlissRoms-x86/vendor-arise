Auditory Research in Sound Enhancement™


A.R.I.S.E. Sound Systems™ is excited to bring the next generation of mobile audio sound enhancement to all Android devices with root or a custom recovery. We are purposed in providing a top-shelf audio experience beyond anything available anywhere with unmatched support in device compatibility and assistance to users. Our available sound systems are unique among each other and are named sequentially using the books and their order of the holy bible (not a reflection of team views, just a unique naming scheme). Experience a new level of sound modification through the most premium mobile audio sound systems ever made available.

Greater than the sum of its parts...

A.R.I.S.E. Sound Systems™ is an established and renowned Android audio development project known best for its cutting edge sound systems and trendsetting techniques, perhaps known even more for its unmatched support and assistance for users and its unrivalled community, breaking XDA records for activity, accolades only possible by doing things the right way, every day.

Many contributors make this project possible by managing the various groups and communities outside of XDA, providing the highest level of courteous assistance available anywhere. These contributors, many behind the scenes, are the backbone of this project and allow us to grow day by day in every aspect of the project. They are recognized as contributors towards the bottom of the OP. And of course, the entire ARISE™ family and community, the lifeblood of the project and an exemplary example of a forum's thread at its finest.
